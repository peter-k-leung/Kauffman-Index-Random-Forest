# Kauffman-Index-Random-Forest

Understanding the demographics, geography, and work background of current entrepreneurs in the United States is valuable information for investors who are looking for where their money can go the furthest. Therefore, in this project, I decided to analyze a dataset to help predict which characteristics are the most valuable in determining whether or not someone will become an entrepreneur through a random forest model. Through the results, I was able to determine that oneâ€™s state is the top factor in predicting if someone would become an entrepreneur.
